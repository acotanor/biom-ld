	abstract = {A Universally Unique Identifier ({UUID}) is a 128-bit label used to uniquely identify objects in computer systems. The term Globally Unique Identifier ({GUID}) is also used, mostly in Microsoft systems.
When generated according to the standard methods, {UUIDs} are, for practical purposes, unique. Their uniqueness does not depend on a central registration authority or coordination between the parties generating them, unlike most other numbering schemes. While the probability that a {UUID} will be duplicated is not zero, it is generally considered close enough to zero to be negligible.
Thus, anyone can create a {UUID} and use it to identify something with near certainty that the identifier does not duplicate one that has already been, or will be, created to identify something else. Information labeled with {UUIDs} by independent parties can therefore be later combined into a single database or transmitted on the same channel, with a negligible probability of duplication.

Adoption of {UUIDs} is widespread, with many computing platforms providing support for generating them and for parsing their textual representation.},

Here we describe the Illumina-based metagenomic sequencing, assembly and characterization of 3.3 million non-redundant microbial genes, derived from 576.7 gigabases of sequence, from faecal samples of 124 European individuals. The gene set, ∼150 times larger than the human gene complement, contains an overwhelming majority of the prevalent (more frequent) microbial genes of the cohort and probably includes a large proportion of the prevalent human intestinal microbial genes. The genes are largely shared among individuals of the cohort. Over 99\% of the genes are bacterial, indicating that the entire cohort harbours between 1,000 and 1,150 prevalent bacterial species and each individual at least 160 such species, which are also largely shared. We define and describe the minimal gut metagenome and the minimal gut bacterial genome in terms of functions present in all individuals and most bacteria, respectively.},

Finally, to establish a unified standard for describing sequence data and to provide a single point of entry for the scientific community to access and learn about {GSC} checklists, we present the minimum information about any (x) sequence ({MIxS}).

	abstract = {The {FAIR} principles have been widely cited, endorsed and adopted by a broad range
of stakeholders since their publication in 2016. By intention, the 15 {FAIR}
guiding principles do not dictate specific technological implementations, but
provide guidance for improving Findability, Accessibility,
Interoperability and Reusability of digital resources. This has likely
contributed to the broad adoption of the {FAIR} principles, because individual
stakeholder communities can implement their own {FAIR} solutions. However, it has
also resulted in inconsistent interpretations that carry the risk of leading to
incompatible implementations. Thus, while the {FAIR} principles are formulated on
a high level and may be interpreted and implemented in different ways, for true
interoperability we need to support convergence in implementation choices that
are widely accessible and (re)-usable. We introduce the concept of {FAIR}
implementation considerations to assist accelerated global
participation and convergence towards accessible, robust, widespread and
consistent {FAIR} implementations. Any self-identified stakeholder community may
either choose to reuse solutions from existing implementations,
or when they spot a gap, accept the challenge to create the
needed solution, which, ideally, can be used again by other communities in the
future. Here, we provide interpretations and implementation considerations
(choices and challenges) for each {FAIR} principle.},
